# Pricing Guide

Ciyex Hub apps use transparent pricing models designed for healthcare practices. Many core apps are completely free.

**Examples:**

### Usage-Based

Pay only for what you use. Charges are calculated per unit (messages, minutes, tokens, etc.).

### Fixed Monthly

Flat monthly subscription for unlimited use within your organization.

**Examples:**

### Percentage-Based

A percentage of revenue processed through the app.

**Examples:**

### Tiered

Volume-based pricing with tiers that decrease per-unit cost at scale.
