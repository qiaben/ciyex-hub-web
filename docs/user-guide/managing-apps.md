# Managing Apps

Once apps are installed, you can manage them from the Hub Installed page.

## Viewing Installed Apps

1. Navigate to **Ciyex Hub → Installed**
2. You'll see a grid of all installed apps with their status

Each installed app card shows:

- App name and icon
- Current status (Active, Suspended, Uninstalled)
- Subscription details
- Quick actions (Configure, Uninstall)

## App Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | App is running and fully functional |
| **Suspended** | App is temporarily disabled (e.g., payment issue) |
| **Trial** | App is in free trial period |
| **Uninstalled** | App has been removed (soft-delete) |

## Uninstalling an App

1. Go to **Ciyex Hub → Installed**
2. Click the **Uninstall** button on the app card
3. Confirm the uninstallation

When you uninstall an app:

- The subscription is cancelled in the marketplace
- Any active billing stops (prorated for fixed-price plans)
- The app's UI elements are removed from your EHR
- Data created by the app is **retained** for compliance purposes
- You can reinstall the app later if needed

## Updating App Configuration

See [App Configuration](/docs/user-guide/app-configuration) for details on customizing app settings.

## Viewing App Usage

See [Usage Tracking](/docs/user-guide/usage-tracking) for monitoring app usage and costs.
