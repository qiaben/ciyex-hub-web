# Usage Tracking

Ciyex Hub provides detailed usage tracking for all installed apps, helping you monitor costs and optimize your app portfolio.

## Accessing Usage Data

1. Navigate to **Ciyex Hub → Usage**
2. View usage summaries by app, time period, and provider

## Usage Dashboard

The usage dashboard shows:

- **Total spend** for the current billing period
- **Per-app usage** breakdown
- **Usage trends** over time
- **Per-provider** usage for usage-based apps

## Metering

For usage-based apps, the following events are tracked:

| App | Unit | Example |
|-----|------|---------|
| Communications | Messages | 1 email = 1 message |
| Telehealth | Session minutes | 30-min call = 30 units |
| Ask Ciya (AI) | Tokens (1K) | 1 query ≈ 2-4K tokens |
| File Storage | GB stored | Updated daily |
| Patient Payments | Transactions | 1 payment = 1 txn |

## HIPAA Audit Log

Every app launch is logged for HIPAA compliance:

- **Who** launched the app (user ID)
- **When** the launch occurred
- **Which patient** was in context (if applicable)
- **Which encounter** was in context (if applicable)
- **Launch type** (native, SMART, external)

Access audit logs from **Settings → Audit Logs** in your EHR.

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Review unused apps** — Uninstall apps with zero usage
2. **Monitor trial periods** — Set reminders before trials end
3. **Use free alternatives** — Some core features have free equivalents
4. **Optimize AI usage** — Configure token limits per provider to control costs
