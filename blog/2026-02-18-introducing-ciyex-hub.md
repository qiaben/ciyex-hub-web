## What is Ciyex Hub?

Ciyex Hub is where healthcare practices discover, install, and manage apps that extend their electronic health records. Think of it as the App Store for your EHR — but built specifically for healthcare.

## Launching with 10+ Apps

Ciyex Hub launches with a curated catalog of first-party apps:

- **Ciyex Medical Codes** — ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS, CDT, SNOMED, LOINC, and more
- **Ciyex Communications** — Email, SMS, fax, and in-app notifications
- **Ciyex Telehealth** — HIPAA-compliant video consultations
- **Ciyex RCM** — Full revenue cycle management
- **Ciyex Screen Builder** — Low-code form and workflow designer
- **Ask Ciya** — AI-powered clinical assistant
- And more...

## Key Features

### One-Click Install

No more manual integrations. Browse the catalog, click install, and the app is live in your EHR instantly.

### FHIR R4 Native

All apps communicate using HL7 FHIR R4 standards. Seamless data exchange between your EHR and any installed app.

### Transparent Pricing

Many core apps are free. Paid apps use transparent pricing models — per-use, monthly, or percentage-based. No hidden fees.

### Developer Friendly

Want to build your own healthcare app? Our developer portal, SMART on FHIR support, and webhook events make it easy to create apps that integrate deeply with Ciyex EHR.

## Get Started

Open Ciyex Hub from your EHR sidebar (look for the Store icon), or [browse the app catalog](/apps) right here.

For developers, check out the [Developer Guide](/docs/developer-guide/overview) to start building.
